## Leigh-Ann Gant

I studied Biological Sciences at university and after several years working in roles that didn't engage me I decided to change my path to a career that suited my interests. I am motivated, adaptable, hard working and creative with a range of technical and workplace experience.  I come from a corporate background and I have the ability to work well under pressure, whilst maintaining a high level of accuracy working within result and quality controlled enviroments. I believe I thrive in fast paced and dynamic enviroments, and enjoy changes in approach and technology.

After a few months of self teaching to code I have been recently been selected for the highly competitive Makers Fellowship role. After completing the course and learning the best coding practice, I want to use these newly developed skills and my previous experience to move into a Junior Developer role to bring projects and ideas to life. 

## Skills

#### Proactive in my own and others development
Whilst working full time within a completely unrelated field I decided to teach myself how to code. I researched the field and decided Ruby was a good starting point. I went from being unable to name any programming language to being able to create a automated card game, developed in a test driven enviroment. Prior to starting Makers Academy I built this program https://github.com/Leigan0/beat-the-dealer-21
 
 Whilst working in a previous role, I gave a lot of support and assisstance to new starters. This was recognised by my senior manager and I was quickly promoted to a quality assurance role. As part of this role I implemented training packages, hosted complex Q&A sessions and completed case checks to provide regular feedback to staff. As part of the role I also identified common knowledge gaps, and hosted refresher training for all employees to maintain high quality. 

#### Exceptional reasoning and problem solving skills
Within my recent role as an Adjudicator at the Financial Ombudsman Service I was required to resolve disputes between large financial organisations and consumers.  Any resolution must be agreed upon by both the business and the consumer, and must be resolved in an impartial manner following a process to reach a reasonable and logical solution. I would collate and analyse all available evidence, probing both the consumer and businesses for further evidence where discrepancies were identified
All conclusions had to be unbiased and fair to each party, whilst working at the service 95% of my caseload was resolved without the need for escalation.
