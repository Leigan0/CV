## Leigh-Ann Gant

I studied Biological Sciences at university and after several years working in roles that didn't engage me I decided to change my path to a career that suited my interests. I am motivated, adaptable, hard working and creative with a range of technical and workplace experience.  I come from a corporate background and I have the ability to work well under pressure, whilst maintaining a high level of accuracy working within result and quality controlled enviroments. I believe I thrive in fast paced and dynamic enviroments, and enjoy changes in approach and technology.

After a few months of self teaching to code I have been recently been selected for the highly competitive Makers Fellowship role. After completing the course and learning the best coding practice, I want to use these newly developed skills and my previous experience to move into a Junior Developer role to bring projects and ideas to life.
