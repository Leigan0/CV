I would describe myself as motivated, adaptable and hardworking. After several years of trying to work in roles and industries that did not engage me I made the bold move of changing careers. I enjoy solving problems and creating things, but I lack artistic flare... so once I tried coding I haven't looked back!

I spent a few months teaching myself to code, and was then selected for the highly competitive [Makers Fellowship role](http://www.makersacademy.com/). After completing the course and learning the best coding practice, I want to use these newly developed skills and my previous experience to move into a Junior Developer role to bring projects and ideas to life.

## Skills

#### Fast independent Learner
Whilst working full time within a completely unrelated field I decided to teach myself how to code. I researched the field and decided Ruby was a good starting point. I went from being unable to name any programming language to being able to create a automated card game, developed in a test driven manner. Prior to starting Makers Academy I built this [program](https://github.com/Leigan0/beat-the-dealer-21).

I come from a corporate background and I have the ability to work well under pressure, whilst maintaining a high level of accuracy working within result and quality controlled environments. I believe I thrive in fast-paced, dynamic environments and enjoy changes in approach and technology.

#### Great communicator
Within my recent role as an Adjudicator at the Financial Ombudsman Service, I was required to resolve disputes between large financial organisations and consumers. Resolutions often required difficult conversations with stakeholders. The role greatly improved my communication skills and gave me invaluable experience in open and constructive communication.

Within previous roles I have also provided training in theory and practice through a variety of mediums, including demonstrations, workshops and one to one coaching sessions.


#### Great collaborator
During my Makers experience I have had the opportunity to work as a team on technical projects. The project weeks have been the most rewarding and enjoyable weeks on the course.

## Education

#### Makers Academy (November 2017 - March 2018)

Makers has provided me with a great understanding of coding fundamentals and best practices and we've only just scraped the surface. Over the 12 weeks I have built many projects all in a TDD manner using agile methodologies.

Here are some of the projects I completed on the course, compared to my pre course attempt you can see how far I have come:
